# Cab-sharing-project
The aim is to make a website that provides an interface for users to post cab timings and venues. People commuting from one point to another can share empty seats with other passengers who are traveling on the same route. It also has features like inbuilt messaging and emergency booking.   
The website is now complete with the following main features:
1)Chat feature is avalable with features like shown active status(online/offline) ,shows typing when a person types
2)Groups of upto four people can me made to share the cab.
3)To share a cab with other people you have to send them a request.
4)If the request is accepted then you will be added to the group.
5)Live cancelling- booking can be cancelled any time.Also,you can leave the group if you want.
6)Feedback can be submitted.
For anyone who use my repository:
Use manage.py runserver in one window & manage.py run_chat _server in another window to run my web application
